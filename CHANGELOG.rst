==========
What's new
==========

Starting with SynthPops version 1.5.2, this file will document all changes to the codebase. By nature, SynthPops is a library to generate stochastic networked populations, so over time there will be model and code updates that change regression results. When these kinds of changes are made, we'll flag that here with the term "Regression Information". In addition, here are some other terms useful for understanding updates documented here.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Latest versions (1.9.x  – 1.10.x)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Version 1.10.4 (2021-07-05)
---------------------------
- Update to README to include the working title of the manuscript. We're doing this so that if people start using the model prior to the manuscript being available, they will still cite the work appropriately instead of using just the website.


Version 1.10.3 (2021-05-25)
---------------------------
- *Fix*: Addressing a bug when schools smaller than expected by the school size distributions are created in the case where there are not enough students left to place in the selected type of school.
- *Github Info*: PR `505 <https://github.com/amath-idm/synthpops/pull/505>`__


Version 1.10.2 (2021-05-22)
---------------------------
- Adding new json data files plus some example scripts to show users how to make their own json data files from individual raw data files for a given location.
- *Github Info*: PRs `494 <https://github.com/amath-idm/synthpops/pull/494>`__, `506 <https://github.com/amath-idm/synthpops/pull/506>`__


Version 1.10.1 (2021-05-20)
---------------------------
- *Fix*: Reinstating previous tests on methods within ``sp.data.py`` and updating ``sp.load_location_from_json_str()`` to take an optional parameter to control when checks on data loading are performed.
- *Github Info*: PR `502 <https://github.com/amath-idm/synthpops/pull/502>`__


Version 1.10.0 (2021-05-20)
---------------------------
- *Feature*: Ports Covasim's ``People`` class to SynthPops, and adds a new method to the ``Pop`` object, ``to_people()``. 
- While the differences are numerous, the major difference is that the ``People`` class stores data as NumPy arrays rather than as dicts or objects. This leads to performance improvements, at a cost of reduced flexibility. Most notable, ``people.contacts`` is a single edge list per layer, which is very fast to iterate over. Other quantities, such as ``people['age']``, are also flat vectors. 
- This functionality is not imported into the global SynthPops namespace; you can use it via ``sp.people.People()`` or ``import synthpops.people as spp; spp.People()``.
- In future, these new classes and functions will be incorporated more tightly into the main SynthPops ``Pop`` class.
- *Github*: PR `497 <https://github.com/amath-idm/synthpops/pull/497>`__


Version 1.9.3 (2021-05-20)
--------------------------
- *Feature*: Minor feature update - plotting methods will now automatically search for location information to include in the figure titles. In order of `location`, `state_location`, `country_location`, ``sp.plotting.plkwargs.make_title()`` will look for the first available string to prefix the figure title.
- This update also changes behavior of some logging statements when using plotting methods. Instead of always sending users information about kwargs missing and the value of defaults being used in place, this behavior is now available under the debug mode for SynthPops.
- *Github Info*: PR `498 <https://github.com/amath-idm/synthpops/pull/498>`__


Version 1.9.2 (2021-05-20)
--------------------------
- *Fix*: Fix to how different layer classes get ages of members in the group or subgroups within. Specifically, this fixes how ages for members of schools and long term care facilities are calculated so that these layer classes can also call on the ages of members with specific roles in the class (i.e., students vs. teachers vs. non-teaching staff, or residents vs. staff). Tests have been added to verify these methods now work as expected.
- Slight reorganizing of module imports in ``pop.py``
- *Github Info*: PR `495 <https://github.com/amath-idm/synthpops/pull/495>`__


Version 1.9.1 (2021-05-20)
--------------------------
- *Fix*: Fixing the logic in ``sp.contact_networks.get_contact_counts_by_layer`` so that it no longer returns an empty list in the dictionary counting contacts by layer group id, but rather returns lists populated with actual counts. Test assertions have also been added to catch this in case of future refactor work; see ``test_plotting.py:test_plot_contact_counts_on_pop``.
- *Github Info*: PR `483 <https://github.com/amath-idm/synthpops/pull/483>`__


Version 1.9.0 (2021-05-16)
--------------------------
- Data folder cleaned up and removed individual csv data files now that synthpops has json data files instead for the collection of data used for each location.
- Json data objects also updated with documentation on the sources for the original and estimated data. When data have been estimated or inferred, to the best of our ability, we've added a note about this in the notes field.
- *Github Info*: PR `427 <https://github.com/amath-idm/synthpops/pull/427>`__


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Versions 1.8.x (1.8.0 – 1.8.4)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Version 1.8.4 (2021-05-14)
--------------------------
- *Fix*: Catching rare events when schools are created with fewer than the smallest expected school size because there are no more students left to place in a school.
- *Feature*: Additional functionality to allow for the average classroom size to be different based on school mixing type (random, age_clustered, or age_and_class_clustered). 
- Warning users when average class size and the average student teacher ratio parameters are incompatible as well as how synthpops handles these situations. 
- *Fix*: Logic on how average class size and the average student teacher ratio parameters interact to create cohorts of students when the mixing type is age_and_class_clustered. The cohort size is drawn from a poisson on the larger of the two values. Why? Because for schools where students are cohorted into classrooms, there should be at least one teacher per classroom (average student teacher ratio), but there may be more than one (if average class size > average student teacher ratio).
- *Regression Information*: Refactoring related to schools as described above.
- *Github*: PR `459 <https://github.com/amath-idm/synthpops/pull/459>`__


Version 1.8.3 (2021-05-14)
--------------------------
- *Fix*: Refactored population generation methods to first determine the ages to be generated or expected to be generated, then have this be an input for methods to generate long term care facility residents' ages, and then methods to generate households and household member ages for the rest of the population residing in that layer. Addresses small n population bug identified with the household_method of 'fixed_ages' (issues `311 <https://github.com/amath-idm/synthpops/issues/311>`__ / `333 <https://github.com/amath-idm/synthpops/issues/333>`__) and allows for arbitrarily small populations (n > 0) to be created, although with smaller n matching the age distribution expected gets harder. 
- *Fix*: Also fixes zero division errors when calculating pop properties like the enrollment and employment rates by age when there is at least one age with a count of zero people in the population (issue `383 <https://github.com/amath-idm/synthpops/issues/383>`__).
- Moved all household generation methods to sp.households
- Method to generate the count of household sizes for a fixed population renamed: ``sp.households.generate_household_sizes_from_fixed_pop_size`` --> ``sp.households.generate_household_size_count_from_fixed_pop_size``
- ``sp.households.generate_larger_household_sizes`` generalized to all household sizes (now including size 1) in sp.households.generate_household_sizes
- ``sp.households.generate_larger_household_head_ages`` generalized to all household sizes (now including size 1) in ``sp.households.generate_household_head_ages``
- New method: ``sp.households.generate_age_count_multinomial``
- *Deprecated*: ``sp.households.generate_household_head_age_by_size``, ``sp.households.generate_living_alone``, ``sp.households.generate_living_alone_method_2``
- *Regression Information*: Refactoring population generation methods to first determine the ages to be generated and then place people in residences produces a stochastic change in the regression population. Take a look at how the generated age distributions compare to the expected via pop.plot_ages().
- *Github Info*: PRs: `384 <https://github.com/amath-idm/synthpops/pull/384>`__


Version 1.8.2 (2021-05-12)
--------------------------
- *Fix*: Fix changes when constraints and other checks are performed in the data loading step. Now all checks should be performed only once after synthpops has checked the location and all of its parent locations for the necessary data to create the networked populations.
- *Github*: PR `485 <https://github.com/amath-idm/synthpops/pull/485>`__


Version 1.8.1 (2021-05-09)
--------------------------
- *Fix*: Minor fix to how the expected data are called when plotting the head of household age distributions by household size in ``sp.plotting.plot_household_head_ages_by_size()``. Temporarily this method set the location parameter to None when the ability to traverse up parent locations was not yet functional. With that implemented now, we can keep information about all levels of the location and synthpops will look for the first data set available starting from the child location and moving upwards through all parent locations.
- *Github*: PR `478 <https://github.com/amath-idm/synthpops/pull/478>`__


Version 1.8.0 (2021-05-07)
--------------------------
- This is a big one!
- *Feature*: Class structures implemented for each layer and added to pop objects generated via `pop = sp.Pop()`. For example, now you can do ``pop.get_household(i)`` to get the household with integer ``hhid`` with value ``i`` which will be a ``sp.Household`` object with at minimum the attributes ``hhid``, ``member_uids``, ``reference_uid``, and ``reference_age``.
- Base class for layer groups available in ``sp.base.py``; see class ``sp.base.LayerGroup()`` for more info. Important to note that this class has a method ``member_ages()`` which takes in a mapping of person ids to age to return the ages of individuals in a layer group. Optional parameter `subgroup_member_uids` allows you to return the ages for a subgroup of individuals.
- The specific layer classes implemented are ``sp.Household``, ``sp.School``, ``sp.Classroom``, ``sp.Workplace``, ``sp.LongTermCareFacility``. Each is based off of ``sp.LayerGroup``.
- Class also added for classroom structures in schools when schools are strictly cohorted into classrooms (school_mixing_type equals 'age_and_class_clustered').
- Method name changes: ``sp.get_age_by_brackets_dic()`` -> ``sp.get_age_by_brackets()``, ``sp.get_index_by_brackets_dic()`` -> ``sp.get_index_by_brackets()``, ``sp.get_ids_by_age_dic()`` -> ``sp.get_ids_by_age()``, ``sp.make_contacts_from_microstructure_objects()`` -> ``sp.make_contacts()``, ``sp.get_contact_matrix_dic()`` -> ``sp.get_contact_matrices()``, 
- ``sp.make_contacts()`` now returns a tuple; a dictionary version of the population and a dictionary version of schools to identify classrooms and other other groupings in schools. These are then used to populate the school and classroom structures in ``sp.Pop.generate()``.
- *Regression Information*: Attribute names related to Long Term Care Facilities have changed to be more consistent with class name; ``snfid`` -> ``ltcfid``, ``snf_res`` -> ``ltcf_res``, ``snf_staff`` -> ``ltcf_staff``.
- *Github*: PR `347 <https://github.com/amath-idm/synthpops/pull/347>`__


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Versions 1.7.x (1.7.0 – 1.7.7)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Version 1.7.7 (2021-05-07)
--------------------------
- Made changes to allow SynthPops to be installed via ``pip``.
- Updated examples in the folder ``synthpops/examples``.
- Most significantly, changed the default data folder from ``synthpops/data`` to ``synthpops/synthpops/data``.
- *Github*: PRs: `465 <https://github.com/amath-idm/synthpops/pull/465>`__


Version 1.7.6 (2021-05-05)
--------------------------
- Updated random graph model to use networkx's fast Erdos-Renyi graph generator implementation, which speeds up generation time for the model.
- *Regression Information*: The fast Erdos Renyi graph implementation changes the edges chosen, though not the statistical properties of the degree distribution.
- *Github*: PRs: `449 <https://github.com/amath-idm/synthpops/pull/449>`__


Version 1.7.5 (2021-05-03)
--------------------------
- ``sp.contact_networks.get_contact_counts_by_layer()`` now returns two dictionaries, one that gives the number of contacts between different roles in settings, like the number of contacts for students to teachers in schools, as well as the number of contacts per group in a setting, for example the number of contacts people have in the workplace with `wpid == 0`.
- ``sp.sampling.statistic_test()`` with `verbose = True` prints to screen details about the expected and actual distributions when the test fails. 
- *Fix*: Default `n` value now assigned in ``sp.defaults.py`` when ``sp.Pop`` supplied `n = None` and when `n` is lower than ``sp.defaults.default_pop_size``
- *Github*: PRs `435 <https://github.com/amath-idm/synthpops/pull/435>`__, `448 <https://github.com/amath-idm/synthpops/pull/448>`__


Version 1.7.4 (2021-04-21)
--------------------------
- *Feature*: new summary information added to pop objects: ``pop.summary.average_age``, ``pop.summary.layer_degrees``, ``pop.summary.layer_stats``, and ``pop.summary.layer_degree_description``, using the pandas DataFrame describe method. These give information on the overall degree distribution as well as the degree distribution by age for different layers generated using synthpops. Methods added to calculate these are generalized so in principle if other layers are added to the population post hoc or if connections change, these information can be re-calculated.
- Also added is ``pop.summarize()`` which will print to screen and return a string of a brief description of the population generated using SynthPops.
- *Github* : PR `442 <https://github.com/amath-idm/synthpops/pull/442>`__ 


Version 1.7.3 (2021-04-16)
--------------------------
- *Fix*: Restructured how default location parameters are stored; now moved from ``sp.config.py`` into a dictionary available from ``sp.defaults.py``. Methods added in ``sp.defaults.py`` to reset these values to user specified information.
- *Deprecated*: ``sp.get_config_data()`` is no longer available. The data returned from that method are now simply stored as a dictionary available as ``sp.defaults.default_data``. Previous globally available parameters, most of which were not in use: ``sp.datadir``, ``sp.localdatadir``, ``sp.rel_path``, ``sp.alt_rel_path``, ``sp.default_country``, ``sp.default_state``, ``sp.default_location``, ``sp.default_sheet_name``, ``sp.alt_location``, ``sp.default_household_size_1_included``, are either now stored in and accesible via ``sp.defaults.py`` or removed from use.
- *Github*: PRs `436 <https://github.com/amath-idm/synthpops/pull/436>`__, `438 <https://github.com/amath-idm/synthpops/pull/438>`__


Version 1.7.2 (2021-04-13)
--------------------------
- *Feature*: Re-enabled support of age distributions for any number of age brackets. Json data files have been updated to accomodate this flexibility.
- *Fix*: Catching division by zero when calculating enrollment, employment, etc. rates by age and the number of people in a given age is zero (can occur when population size is very small, e.g. n~200).
- *Github Info*: PRs `401 <https://github.com/amath-idm/synthpops/pull/401>`__, `422 <https://github.com/amath-idm/synthpops/pull/422>`__


Version 1.7.1 (2021-04-09)
--------------------------
- *Feature*: Added checks for probability distributions with methods ``sp.check_all_probability_distribution_sums()``, ``sp.check_all_probability_distrubution_nonnegative()``, ``sp.check_probability_distribution_sum()``, ``sp.check_probability_distribution_nonnegative()``. These check that probabilities sum to 1 within a tolerance level  (0.05), and have all non negative values. Added method to convert data from pandas dataframe to json array style, ``sp.convert_df_to_json_array()``. Added statistical test method ``sp.statistic_test()``. Added method to count contacts, ``sp.get_contact_counts_by_layer()``, and method to plot the results, ``sp.plot_contact_counts()``. See ``sp.contact_networks.get_contact_counts_by_layer()`` for more details on the method.
- Added example of how to load data into the location json objects and save to file. See ``examples/create_location_data.py`` and ``examples/modify_location_data.py``.
- *Github Info*: PRs `410 <https://github.com/amath-idm/synthpops/pull/410>`__, `413 <https://github.com/amath-idm/synthpops/pull/413>`__, `423 <https://github.com/amath-idm/synthpops/pull/423>`__


Version 1.7.0 (2021-04-05)
--------------------------
- *Efficiency*: Major refactor of data methods to read from consolidated json data files for each location and look for missing data from parent locations or alternatively json data files for default locations. Migration of multiple data files for locations into a single json object per location under the ``data`` directory. This will should make it easier to identify all of the available data per location and where missing data are read in from. Examples of how to create, change, and save new json data files will come in the next minor version update.
- *Feature*: Location data jsons now have fields for the data source, reference links, and citations! These fields will be fully populated shortly. Please reference the links provided for any data obtained from SynthPops as most population data are sourced from other databases and should be referenced as such.
- *Deprecated*: Refactored data methods no longer support the reading in of data from user specified file paths. Use of methods to read in age distributions aggregated to a number of age brackets not equal to 16, 18, or 20 (officially supported values) is currently turned off. Next minor update will re-enable these features. Old methods are available in `synthpops.data_distributions_legacy.py`, however this file will be removed in upcoming versions once we have migrated all examples to use the new data methods and have fully enabled all the functionality of the original data methods. Please update your usage of SynthPops accordingly.
- Updated documentation about the input data layers.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Versions 1.6.x (1.6.0 – 1.6.2)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Version 1.6.2 (2021-04-01)
--------------------------
- *Feature*: Added new methods, ``sp.get_household_head_ages_by_size()``, ``sp.plot_household_head_ages_by_size()``. Also accessible pop methods as ``pop.get_household_head_ages_by_size()``, ``pop.plot_household_head_ages_by_size()``. These calculate the generated count the household head age by the household size, and the plotting methods compare this to the expected age distributions by size as matrices.
- *Github Info*: PR `385 <https://github.com/amath-idm/synthpops/pull/385>`__


Version 1.6.1 (2021-03-25)
--------------------------
- *Feature*: Added new methods, ``sp.check_dist()`` and aliases ``sp.check_normal()`` and ``sp.check_poisson()``, to check whether the observed distribution matches the expected distribution.
- *Github Info*: PR `373 <https://github.com/amath-idm/synthpops/pull/373>`__


Version 1.6.0 (2021-03-20)
--------------------------
- *Feature*: Adding summary methods for SynthPops pop objects accesible as pop.summary and computed using pop.compute_summary(). Also adding several plotting methods for these summary data.
- Updating ``sp.workplaces.assign_rest_of_workers()`` to work off a copy of the workplace age mixing matrix so that the copy stored in SynthPops pop objects is not modified during generation.
- More tests for summary methods in pop.py, methods in config.py, plotting methods in plotting.py
- *Regression Information*: Adding new workplace size data specific for the Seattle metro area which changes the regression results. The previous data from the Washington state level and the new data for the metropolitan statistical area (MSA) of Seattle for the 2019 year are very similar, however the use of this data with random number generators does result in slight stochastic differences in the populations generated. 
- *Github Info*: PRs `356 <https://github.com/amath-idm/synthpops/pull/356>`__, `357 <https://github/com/amath-idm/synthpops/pull/357>`__, `358 <https://github.com/amath-idm/synthpops/pull/358>`__, `360 <https://github.com/amath-idm/synthpops/pull/360>`__
