    """
    Generate the ages of those living in households together. First create
    households of people living alone, then larger households. For households
    larger than 1, a reference individual's age is sampled conditional on the
    household size, while all other household members have their ages sampled
    conditional on the reference person's age and the age mixing contact matrix
    in households for the population under study.

    Args:
        n (int)                     : The number of people in the population.
        n_remaining (int)           : The number of people in the population left to place in a residence.
        hh_sizes (array)            : The count of household size s at index s-1.
        hha_by_size_counts (matrix) : A matrix in which each row contains the age distribution of the reference person for household size s at index s-1.
        hha_brackets (dict)         : The age brackets for the heads of household.
        cm_age_brackets (dict)      : The dictionary mapping age bracket keys to age bracket range matching the household contact matrix.
        cm_age_by_brackets (dict)   : The dictionary mapping age to the age bracket range it falls within matching the household contact matrix.
        contact_matrices (dict)     : The dictionary of the age-specific contact matrix for different physical contact settings.
        ages_left_to_assign (dict)  : Age count of people left to place in households larger than one person.

    Returns:
        An array of all households where each household is a row and the values
        in the row are the ages of the household members. The first age in the
        row is the age of the reference individual. Households are randomly
        shuffled by size.

    Note:
        This method is not guaranteed to model the population age distribution
        well automatically. The method called inside,
        generate_larger_households_infer_ages uses the method ltcf_resample_age to
        fit Seattle, Washington populations with long term care facilities
        generated. For a method that matches the age distribution well for
        populations in general, please use generate_all_households_fixed_ages.

        The following contains an example of how you may resample from an age
        range that is over produced and instead sample ages from an age range
        that is under produced in your population. This kind of customization
        may be necessary when your age mixing matrix and the population you are
        interested in modeling differ in important but subtle ways. For example,
        generally household age mixing matrices reflect mixing patterns for
        households composed of families. This means household age mixing
        matrices do not generally cover college or university aged individuals
        living together. Without this customization, this algorithm tends to
        under produce young adults. This method also has a tendency to
        underproduce the elderly, and does not explicitly model the elderly
        living in nursing homes. Customizations like this should be considered
        in context of the specific population and culture you are trying to
        model. In some cultures, it is common to live in non-family households,
        while in others family households are the most common and include
        multi-generational family households. If you are unsure of how to
        proceed with customizations please take a look at the references listed
        in the overview documentation for more information.
