Welcome to |SP|
=================

|SP| is used construct synthetic networks of people that satisfy statistical properties of
real-world populations (such as the age distribution, household size, etc.). |SP| can create
generic populations with different network characteristics, as well as synthetic populations that
interact in different layers of a multilayer contact network. These synthetic populations can then
be used with agent-based models like |Cov_l| to simulate epidemics. |SP| is available on GitHub_.
For more information on |Cov_s| see `Covasim on GitHub`_.
