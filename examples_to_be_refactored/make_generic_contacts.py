    Make a popdict of n people, age and sex sampled from Seattle Metro demographics.
    Contacts are created and stored by layer.

    Layers are :
        'H' - households
        'S' - schools
        'W' - workplaces
        'C' - general community

    Use sheet_name to decide which set of age mixing patterns to sample contact
    ages from. Age mixing patterns in the population will match this approximately,
    but contact networks will still be random in the sense that clustering or
    triangles will not be enforced. For example, an individual's contacts in the
    household layer ('H') will match what's expected given their age, but their
    contacts won't have the same contacts as them. This means the model is not
    directly creating households, schools, or worksplaces, but contacts for each
    individual similar to those expected in terms of age. Caveat: students/teachers
    interact at school and workers interact at work, but they won't interact in both.

    What's the purpose of this without clustering you ask?

    Compartmental models routinely use age mixing matrices to model the effects
    of age mixing patterns on infectious disease spreading at the aggregate level.
    Agent based models require information at the individual level and this allows us
    to bring some of that age mixing from compartmental models into an agent based
    modeling framework.
